The :code:`CRpaic` library is a C library specifically designed for studying the
book "Programming Abstractions in C: A Second Course in Computer Science"
(PAIC). This book was written by Eric S. Roberts in 1997, and I consider it to
be, even today, one of the best books for beginner students to learn important
concepts in algorithms and data structures, using the C language as the
implementation tool. Here is an image of the book cover:
